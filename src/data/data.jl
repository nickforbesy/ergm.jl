"""
Save a spatially embedded graph to a file.

The matrix `X` specifies a Euclidean embedding of the graph's nodes.
The ith node of `g` is embedded at the coordinates `X[i, :]`.

The graph is saved as a GraphML file with node positions saved
as node attributes. Note that if you save and then read a graph,
the order of the nodes may not be preserved.

Read a spatially embedded graph from a file.

Returns a SparseDirectedGraph `g` specifying connectivity and a
matrix `X` specifying a Euclidean embedding of the graph's nodes.
The ith node of `g` is embedded at the coordinates `X[i, :]`.

The graph must be stored as a GraphML file with node positions saved
as node attributes. For reference, see the output of `save_spatial_graph`,
which is the inverse of this function up to a possible reordering of the nodes.
